              Google has always been my best friend! The best thing I have ever
              learned is “how to learn”. You can present me with anything and I
              will learn everything there is to learn about it. That’s what I
              love about developing, It challenges me, It stimulates me to use
              my brain and feeds my aptitude for learning and solving problems.

              My interest in web development started during my teenage years,
              when I built websites using HTML / CSS / Wordpress and Shopify. I
              started affiliate websites or even my own e-commerce stores,
              selling fashion items, which I bought at wholesale prices in
              France, Germany and the UK. But after my websites were built and
              up & running, I felt the need to keep building a new website ..
              over and over again. <br />
              <br />
              Through word of mouth, it became known in my circle that I made
              websites and people started coming to me to build their blogs or
              online stores using Wordpress and Shopify. At the time, I never
              pursued development as a career because I didn't fully understand
              what it meant, as I didn't know anyone who worked as a software
              developer. <br />
              <br />Fast-forward to today! Being fluent in multiple languages, I
              have been freelancing as a technical translator for the past few
              years, meaning I translate very difficult language for Fintech or
              Software companies looking to expand their businesses into new
              countries.

              This is when it all started clicking for me again, I was hired to
              translate text in between HTML & Javascript codes, since I could
              clearly understand what was code and what was not. While working
              on these projects, in the back of my mind I was like hmm
              interesting, wouldn’t it be cool to start building things
              again.<br /><br />
              This time around the universe told me loud and clear that now was
              the time to become a developer. Every day I saw advertising
              campaigns of Tech bootcamps, courses and universities that I could
              sign up for. So that's exactly what I did, I enrolled in the
              SheCodes course and I can truly say that I have never enjoyed
              anything so much in my life. <br /><br />Today I can finally say
              that I have found my purpose, this is what I was always meant to
              do, I just hadn't figured it out yet. Sometimes I wish someone had
              told me that years ago ... like hey, you should become a Software
              Developer. But everyone has their own journey and this was my path
              to walk … the important thing is that im here now.
